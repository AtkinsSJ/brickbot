# BrickBot

A Discord bot with Lego-related commands for the [BrickSculpt](https://www.youtube.com/@bricksculpt) server.

## Configuration

The configuration options are in `.env.sample`. Copy that to `.env` and then fill in the various IDs.

## Running

You'll need to register the bot on Discord and set up a server. You can find guides online for that.

Then your server needs [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed.

To run:

1. `npm install` to install dependencies
2. `npm run register` to tell Discord what commands are available
3. `npm run start` to start the bot
